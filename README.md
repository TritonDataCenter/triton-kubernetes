Triton Kubernetes is a multi-cloud Kubernetes solution. It has a global cluster manager (control plane) which can run and manage Kubernetes environments on any cloud - Public, Private or Bare Metal.

The cluster manager manages environments running on any region. AWS, Azure, Google and Triton (public and private) are supported. If you don't want to use a cloud, environments on bare metal servers and VMWare are supported as well.
