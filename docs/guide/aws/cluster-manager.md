## Cluster Manager

Cluster Managers can manage multiple clusters across regions/data-centers and/or clouds. It is a global cluster manager which will run on Triton and manages Kubernetes environments. This cluster manager will manage environments running on any region of any supported cloud.

To create cluster manager, run the following:
```
$ triton-kubernetes create manager

✔ Cloud Provider: AWS
✔ Cluster Manager Name: dev-manager
✔ Private Registry: None
✔ Rancher Server Image: Default
✔ Rancher Agent Image: Default

```

To destroy cluster manager, run the following:

```
$ triton-kubernetes destroy manager
✔ Backend Provider: Local
✔ Cluster Manager: dev-manager
  Destroy "dev-manager"? Yes
```
> Note: Destorying cluster manager will destroy all your clusters and nodes attached to the cluster manager.

To get cluster manager, run the following:

```
$ triton-kubernetes get manager
```

`triton-kubernetes` cli can takes a configuration file (yaml) with `--config` option to run in silent mode.To read about the yaml arguments, look at the [silent-install documentation](https://github.com/joyent/triton-kubernetes/tree/master/docs/guide/silent-install-yaml.md).
